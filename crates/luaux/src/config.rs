//! `luaux.toml` — element and property aliases (PLAN.md §8).
//!
//! ```toml
//! [elements]              # overrides for default (Roblox) element names
//! TextLabel = "text"
//!
//! [properties]            # applies to all elements
//! TextColor3 = "textColor"
//!
//! [properties.Frame]      # per-class; beats the global table
//! BackgroundColor3 = "bgColor"
//! ```
//!
//! Overrides are **exclusive**: renaming a name retires the original, so once
//! `TextLabel = "text"` is declared, `<TextLabel>` is an error and `<text>` is
//! the spelling. That is what makes a project's vocabulary consistent rather
//! than offering two ways to write everything.
//!
//! A per-class entry can map a name to itself — `[properties.TextLabel]
//! TextColor3 = "TextColor3"` — to opt one class back out of a global rename.
